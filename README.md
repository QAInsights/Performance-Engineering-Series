# ‚ö° Performance Engineering Series

This video series aims to explain various performance issues such as memory, cpu, threads etc and how to identify them by simulating using the BuggyApp.

# ‚öô Tools required

- Eclipse MAT
- BuggyApp
- yCrash

# Other Utilities

- `jcmd`
    - Frequently used commands:
        - `jcmd -l` to list out all the running processes
        - `jcmd <process-id> VM.flags` - to view all the JVM arguments
- `jps`
    - Frequently used commands:
        - `jps`
- `jinfo`
    - Frequently used commands:
        - `jinfo -flags <process-id>` - to print all the VM flags
        - `jinfo -sysprops <process-id>` - to view system properties
